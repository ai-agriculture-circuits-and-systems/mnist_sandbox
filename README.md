# Introduction

![MNIST Examples](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/MnistExamples.png)

This project implements a neural network model to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset. The MNIST dataset is a large collection of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems and for testing machine learning algorithms. It contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits (60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing), where each image is 28x28 pixels in grayscale.

# Requirements

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed on your machine. The following packages are required, and you can install them using pip with the provided command: `pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt`.

- `numpy`: A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.
- `torch`: [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), an open-source machine learning library for Python.
- `torchvision`: A PyTorch package that includes datasets and model architectures for computer vision.
- `opencv-python`: An open-source computer vision and machine learning software library.

# Run

To start training on the MNIST digits dataset, execute `train.py` from your Python environment. The training and test data are located in the `data/` folder and were initially curated by Yann LeCun (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

```python
# Example snippet of train.py to showcase its usage.
# This will set up the environment for training a model on MNIST dataset.

# Import necessary libraries (Make sure they are installed as per requirements)
import torch

# Your training script will start here, initialize models, load data, etc.
# ...

# Start the training process
# ...

# Save your trained model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), "path_to_save_model.pt")

# Add suitable comments to each segment of your code for better understanding.
```
